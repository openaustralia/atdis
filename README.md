A ruby interface to the application tracking data interchange specification (ATDIS) API

We're developing this against version ATDIS 1.0.4.

This is **highly alpha** software that probably doesn't yet do what it says on the tin. It is very much a work in progress.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'atdis'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install atdis
